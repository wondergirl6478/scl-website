   My Experiences
</h1>
<p>
   I joined this school when I was in 6th grade. Last year I was the 4th rank in my class.
   I belong to Gautham House. I was a part of the Senior Girls Chess Team for my house and we won first place,
   I have won two prizes in MUNs and I got the chance of saying my MUN speech on Republic Day.
   I scored 100% on the Hindu English Step Test and I was top in my school.
