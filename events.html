    Last year we celebrated Sports Day on November 30. Our school has four houses, Gandhi,Goutham,Tagore and Nehru.
    On Sports Day we had a marching parade led by the Sports Girl and the Sports Boy. 
    We had a relay competition between 6 schools and we gave away prizs to the students who won medals in sports.
